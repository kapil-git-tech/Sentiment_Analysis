# Sentiment Analysis for "AAPL" using twitter data - Yearly data

This notebook examines the relationship between twitter sentiment and stock price.

Part 1 of the notebook focusses on sentiment analysis.

- I have used NLTK's built-in, pretrained sentiment analyzer VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).
The pre-trained sentiment analyzer returns the 'compound' score for each tweet. This score ranges from -1 (most negative) to +1 ( most positive).

Part 2 of the notebook establishes the relationship between twitter sentiment & stock price

- I have downloaded the stock data for Apple from yfinance.
